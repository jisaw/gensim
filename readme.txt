The script that you will want to use is gentool.py

You can use this script by passing in the command line args --text and --fname

--text is followed by the name of the directory holding the edmunds scrape
you wish to use. As of right now 12/19/14 "run001" is the most current.

--fname is followed by the name the output files will use. 

An example would be to run 'python gentool.py --text run001 --fname cars12-19'
